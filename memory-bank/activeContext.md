# Active Context: Current Implementation State

**Last Updated**: December 15, 2025  
**Current Session Focus**: Template is complete with optional files for business and ML projects!

## Current State Summary

### ✅ Completed
1. **Memory Bank Pattern**: 7 core files + 2 optional files created
2. **Core Files**: projectBrief, productContext, activeContext, systemPatterns, techContext, decisionLog, implementationLog
3. **Optional Files**: businessAnalysis (for commercial projects), experimentLog (for ML/data science)
4. **Copilot Instructions**: Fully generic, framework-agnostic, includes behavioral guidelines
5. **README**: Complete documentation with all file purposes explained
6. **Package.json**: Minimal, generic configuration
7. **Mobile Utilities**: iOS and Android build increment scripts preserved
8. **Clean Structure**: All ScheduleBoard-specific content removed
9. **Flexibility**: Now supports traditional software, commercial products, AND ML/data science projects

### 🚧 In Progress
- None! Template is complete and ready to use

### ❌ Not Started (User Fills In)
1. **Project Customization**: User updates Memory Bank with their project details
2. **Tech Stack Definition**: User specifies their chosen technologies
3. **Pattern Documentation**: User adds project-specific patterns as they emerge
4. **Optional Files**: User adds businessAnalysis.md or experimentLog.md if needed

## Immediate Next Steps

### For Template Users:
1. Clone this template to start a new project
2. Update all Memory Bank files with your project specifics
3. Customize `copilot-instructions.md` with your tech stack and patterns
4. Start AI-assisted development with persistent context!

### For Template Maintainers:
- Template is complete and generic
- No further work needed unless adding new generic utilities
- Consider publishing to GitHub as public template

## Current Architectural Decisions

### Generic Template Approach
- **Current Approach**: Framework-agnostic, instruction-driven development
- **Why**: Works with any tech stack, any project type
- **Trade-offs**: Users must fill in their own specifics (but that's the point!)

### Memory Bank as Core Pattern
- **Current Approach**: File-based persistent context for AI assistants
- **Why**: Solves the stateless LLM problem
- **Trade-offs**: Requires discipline to update files (but provides massive value)

## Open Questions

None! Template is complete.

## Blockers

None! Ready to use.

## Context for Next Session

**This is now a GENERIC TEMPLATE!**

If you're a user starting a new project:
1. Clone this repo
2. Update all Memory Bank files with YOUR project details
3. Customize copilot-instructions.md with YOUR tech stack
4. Start building with AI assistance and persistent context!
