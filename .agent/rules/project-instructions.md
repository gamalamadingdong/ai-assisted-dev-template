# Agent Rules — Project Instructions

> **This file is intentionally minimal.** The master instructions live in `.github/instructions/copilot-instructions.md` and are applied automatically to all files via `applyTo: '**'`.
>
> All interaction modes (Orchestrator, Builder, Domain Expert, Conversational), the multi-perspective agent system, working memory protocol, and behavioral guidelines are defined in the master file.
>
> Do NOT duplicate content here. If you need to add project-wide AI behavior rules, update the master file instead.
